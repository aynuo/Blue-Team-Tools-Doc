# ✘ tcpdump
Using TCPdump is like eavesdropping on the network. You can see all the conversations happening between different devices. It’s kind of like being a spy, listening in on all the network traffic to see what’s really going on. You can filter and analyze this traffic to understand the behavior of your network, detect any anomalies, or troubleshoot connectivity issues. It’s a powerful tool for understanding the inner workings of network communication.
