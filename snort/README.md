### Usage

#### Starting Snort

To start Snort, use the following command:

```bash
sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i <interface>
```

Replace `<interface>` with the network interface you want Snort to monitor.

#### Monitoring Traffic

Snort can be used in various modes to monitor network traffic and detect potential threats. Some common modes include:

- **Packet Sniffing:** Snort can be used as a packet sniffer to capture and analyze network traffic.
- **NIDS:** In Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) mode, Snort analyzes network traffic in real-time and alerts on suspicious activity based on predefined rules.
- **IPS:** In Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) mode, Snort can actively block malicious traffic based on predefined rules.

#### Writing Rules

Snort uses rules to define the criteria for detecting network threats. Rules are written in the Snort rule language and consist of various components, including header fields, options, and actions.
